## Data Sources
The two data sources for this project are listed below:
  * https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
  * https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html

## Procedure
Using Splinter and Beautiful Soup, we scraped both the website containing various news articles regarding Mars and the table with Mars temperature information.  We were able to identify the titles and preview text of the news articles and perform a weather analysis using the data contained in the table.

## Weather Analysis
The weather analysis allowed us to answer the following questions:
  1. 12 months exist on Mars.
  2. There are 1,867 days worth of Martian data in the data frame created.
  3. The average low temperature per month ranges from -83.307292 to -68.382979.
  4. The lowest average temperature occurs in month 3 and the highest average temperature occurs in month 8.
  5. The last plot displayed seems to represent a sinusoidal function whose period is approximately 650-700 days, indicating that 1 Martian year is equivalent to 650-700 Earth days.
  
## Output 
All data frames created within the weather analysis are stored in the Output folder.
